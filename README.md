# Professional Skills Software Engineering Assignment

##Summary 

This project requires you to apply the project management techniques discussed in the first semester and a selection of the material studied in your other second year modules to a development project. 

You are part of a development team that wishes to explore the potential of emerging Augmented Reality (AR) technologies for use as an assistive technology. More specifically your team is interested in how AR technologies can be used to help young people of different capabilities play together in a physical play space. You are to create a prototype of an ‘Augmented Play Space’ that helps people with different capabilities play together in the physical world. Your team may choose the play spaces topic/game(s)/subject matter. 

You may focus the design of your augmented play space prototype to support one of two different user groups. You may choose either: 

1. People with visual impairment 
2. People with autism 

The prototype should seek to address some of the typical difficulties these user groups face when playing with other people. You should consider what digital augmentations can be made to a physical play space, the people in it or the physical items/toys used during play to help your chosen user group play with other people more effectively. The AR technology you will be developing for is detailed below.
